# Code42 Senior Web Engineer Excercise

This repo contains an application that explores GitHub users from a few different 
organizations. This app was built using [React][A] and [Semantic UI][B], starting with the 
[create-react-app][C] scaffold utility.

You can find a live version of this app running at [https://cmc42.now.sh][D]

The data is pulled from the public REST Github API v3 and is rate-limited. All requests are 
also capped at 30 results, with no pagination implemented at this point.
