## Code42 Senior Web Engineer Excercise

This repo contains an application that explores GitHub users from a few different 
organizations. This app was built using [React](A) and [Semantic UI](B), starting with the 
[create-react-app](C) scaffold utility.

The data is pulled from the public REST Github API v3 and is rate-limited. All requests are 
also capped at 30 results, with no pagination implemented at this point.
